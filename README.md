# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game repository! In this project, I've implemented a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, I'll provide an overview of the game, its features, and instructions on how to play.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the game board to make their moves.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins by forming a row of three consecutive marks.
- **Draw Detection**: The game also detects when the board is full and no player has won, resulting in a draw.
- **Restart Option**: Players can restart the game at any time to play again.
